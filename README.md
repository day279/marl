Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

Initially created as a group term project for CSE 5522 - Survey of Artificial Intelligence II, and now beginning to be refactored individually.

Abstract:
Many of the popular advances in technology have focused on making human-computer interaction easier. One option is to concisely perform a set of complex actions using simple gestures. Current gesture recognition software is able to handle recognition of a range of gestures, from simple swipes to complex character gestures, using the data available from the assorted sensors on a mobile device. However, these techniques are limited to recognizing only a single gesture at a time. To create useful gesture applications for human-computer interaction, gesture recognition must extend beyond the recognition of single gestures.

In this work we introduce multi-gesture recognition (MGR), a technique for recognizing multiple individual gestures from a continuous stream of gestures. MGR overcomes the single gesture limitation by segmenting a continuous stream of 3D accelerometer data into a sequence of single gesture segments and using a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) to recognize each of the segments.

This work involved building an Android application in Java using LIBSVM framework to collect data, train, and test a multi-class SVM model.
