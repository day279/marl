Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

Initially created as a group term project for CSE 5522 - Survey of Artificial Intelligence II, and now beginning to be refactored individually.

Abstract:
Demand for intelligent agents has been a large motivation in the design and implementation of enemy AI in games. Players want to play against enemies that can act intelligently and are also enjoyable opponents. We propose MARLs, a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Q-learning approach to AI agents with limited message sharing. We believe MARLs will give the enemy agents a human-like feel which occasionally allows players to capitalize on a wrong choice that the AI makes. To evaluate the performance of this cooperative agent, we compare it against an oracle agent with unlimited message sharing and an individual agent with no message passing capacity. We found only minor improvements in performance between the oracle and cooperative agents and between the cooperative and independent agents.
